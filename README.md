# Simple-iOS-Online-Radio-App

This app can stream online radio. But you need an online audio streaming URL(implemented by SHOUTcast or other) for listening.
I added the background playing functionality sothat you can listen radio even if your app is in background.
You can add the audio streaming URL at ViewController.swift file.
